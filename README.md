# Bcu_prediction

This project uses a five models to classify BCUs into FSRQ and BLL
Namely the models are: 
1) Bias Initialisation with Soft Voting
2) Supervised Greedy Pretraining
3) Unsupervised Greedy Pretraining
4) SSL Autoencoder Pretext 
5) SSL Contrastive Classification
where ssl stands for self-supervised learning


The models and the dataset can be found at respective folders, along with the jupiter notebook.
To run a particular model, pls load the model using the appropriate path into the notebook and feel free to experiment with it!
